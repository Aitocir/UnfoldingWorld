# pymug
Pymug is a Python multi-user game package. It uses pure Python 3, TLS sockets for network communication with clients, and [rethinkdb](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb) for server-side storage. You can use it to define game commands in terms of the  [Entity-Component-System](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–component–system) game model.
